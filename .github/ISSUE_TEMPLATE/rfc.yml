        üëã Thank you for contributing to our infrastructure RFC process.

        Please fill out the sections below with as much clarity and context as possible. A mentor will review and guide the discussion.

      label: üìò Overview
      description: What is this RFC about at a high level? What‚Äôs the goal?
      placeholder: |
        This RFC proposes to add a circuit breaker mechanism to the API gateway
        to prevent cascading failures during downstream service outages.

      label: üìö Background & Motivation
      description: Why is this change needed? Provide historical context, incidents, or shortcomings of the current approach.
      placeholder: |
        We experienced 3 outages in Q2 due to one service failure bringing down others.
        A circuit breaker would allow graceful degradation.

      required: true

      description: Describe the technical approach or high-level plan for solving this.
      placeholder: |
        - Use Envoy‚Äôs outlier detection
        - Configure timeouts and fallback responses
        - Integrate with existing observability stack

      label: ‚ùì Alternatives Considered
      description: List other approaches that were considered and why they were not chosen.
      placeholder: |
        - Retry logic: Not effective if downstream remains unavailable
        - Custom middleware: Adds complexity; Envoy provides native support

      description: What are the potential risks, and how might we address them?
      placeholder: |
        - Risk: Circuit breaker false positives
        - Mitigation: Tune thresholds carefully and log all trip events

      label: üì¶ Implementation Plan (Optional)
      description: If known, describe a rough sequence of steps or responsibilities.
      placeholder: |
        1. Design circuit breaker config
        2. Implement in staging
        3. Alert routing rules
        4. Deploy to production with metrics enabled
